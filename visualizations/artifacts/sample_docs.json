Excel aligns each week with one day from the 1st chart so instead of \"Week 1\"'s plot on the graph being somewhere between 9/1-9/7, it's aligned with 9/1.

The router's LAN address is 192.168.1.254. This set-up works fine for all my client computers except in one case:</p>\n\n<p>I have to connect to a client's VPN, and I am using the generic VPN Windows connection to do that (as per their instruction). The VPN connection fails, and I was told by their security guys that the reason is that my IP address is in the 192.168.1.x range, which is the same as their network's. </p>\n\n<p>Question 1: Why does it matter that my internal IP address is on the same range as theirs? Using other VPN clients like CISCO client for other customers whose internal network is in the same range works just fine. Maybe something different with this type of VPN?</p>\n\n<p>Question 2: I also have a Linksys WRT54GS router which I am currently using as a gateway to extend my WIFI range in the office. Can I use it as a router to create a 10.10.1.x subnet, so as to connect with it to the VPN instead? I have tried to switch its Advanced Routing mode to Router (from Gateway), and tried to configure Dynamic routing, as well as static routing, but in both cases it does not work; My PC gets the 10.10.1.x IP address, and I can ping the 10.10.1.1 (the Linksys router's LAN IP address), and even ping 192.168.1.142 (the Linksys router's WAN IP address). But I cannot ping my Thompson router's IP (192.168.1.254). Furthermore, from a PC in the 192.168.1.x network I cannot ping the Linksys router's WAN IP address (192.168.1.142). </p>\n\n<p>Do you have any ideas as to what the problem might be in this case?

I had to setup the DNS for the laptop vpn to  the DNS used on the LAN for resolving things, but doing a tracert on 8.8.8.8 or any other ip doesnt work.

And I'm bringing a laptop with me. I just need an encrypted tunnel that transparently transmits data over the unsafe internet via an encrypted tunnel to my home network, and then back out unencrypted. This is what is not working without the proxy server (which is only a HTTP proxy).</p>\n\n<p>The VPN server is a VM (Virtual Machine) with 2 NIC adapters, the host also has 2 NIC adapters, so NIC0 goes through LAN behind a router from ISP0 and NIC1 is on a router from ISP1 that gives a public IP (the other creates a LAN, with a single public IP).</p>\n\n<p>That I can access my LAN using VPN is just a bonus.
